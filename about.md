I made this website using a template from [**HTML5 UP**](http://html5up.net) and modified it to use Liquid and Jekyll so that it can be run on Github Pages. I initially created this site so that I could learn web-dev skills, with the secondary purpose of providing myself a web presence. Over time it has also become a platform to host random tools like [**24 solver**](/24game.md) and [**timestamp converter**](/timestamp_convertor.md).

### In the event you are on here to phish me:
