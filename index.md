short_bio: Hello! Welcome to my highly under-developed website. I promised I would make this while I was studying abroad, but a case of travelling and exploring overtook me. I currently have an outdated <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ianrodney/">Google Sites</a> and also a slightly less outdated <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ijracesvt">flickr</a>, which is ALSO linked from my Google Sites.

I'm a 20-something Infrastructure Engineer working at [**Databricks**](https://databricks.com/). Before Databricks, I worked as a Security Engineer at [**Anyscale**](https://anyscale.com) and before that I studied, taught & researched at Berkeley. Beyond working, I run & bike quite a bit; I have an on-again, off-again relationship with photography and eventually want to share some of my work on this website. I'm an avid traveler, and usually find that I only pull out the camera when on the go.
