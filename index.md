short_bio: Hello! Welcome to my highly under-developed website. I promised I would make this while I was studying abroad, but a case of travelling and exploring overtook me. I currently have an outdated <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ianrodney/">Google Sites</a> and also a slightly less outdated <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ijracesvt">flickr</a>, which is ALSO linked from my Google Sites.

I'm a 20-something Security Engineer working at [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/). Before Anyscale, I studied, taught & researched at Berkeley. Beyond working, I run & bike quite a bit; I have an on-again, off-again relationship with photography & eventually want to share some of my work on this website. I enjoy traveling and find that it is the only time for photography :O

If you are on here for course material (for some reason), please head over to the [TA'ing](classes.html) tab.
