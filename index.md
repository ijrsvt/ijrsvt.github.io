short_bio: Hello! Welcome to my highly under-developed website. I promised I would make this while I was studying abroad, but a case of travelling and exploring overtook me. I currently have an outdated <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ianrodney/">Google Sites</a> and also a slightly less outdated <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ijracesvt">flickr</a>, which is ALSO linked from my Google Sites.

I'm a early 20s software engineer (recent college grad). Beyond work, I love photography and am excited to eventually begin sharing some photos on this website. I enjoy traveling and find that it when I'm away from my normal life, that I make time for photography :O
